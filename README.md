## Etch-a-Sketch

This project is created to improve my JavaScript skills like the [Etch-a-Sketch project](https://github.com/cansubaydar/etch-a-sketch) that I created following the steps previously given within The Odin Project Foundations.

#### What I learned while working on this project:
- Created a canvas and drew a straight line on the canvas with the arrow keys
-  Added functionality to the buttons, which are designed with CSS, and drew on the canvas when clicked on. 
Also in this project: 
- Added buttons to draw by clicking for mobile users
- Determined a dot randomly that moves on the canvas when the page is refreshed.  
- Created a shake animation which is similar to what the real Etch-a-Sketch does and cleared the canvas by using the clearRect method when the erase button is clicked
- Added two options named black and colourful within pen colour
